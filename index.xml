      <description>Creating custom roles in kubernetes for different requirements =======================
There are plenty of occassions when the default kubernetes/openshift roles / clusterroles don&amp;rsquo;t have the specific permissions that you need to assign to users. I recently faced similar situation where the development teams wanted to be able to setup their on PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims. However, PersistentVolumes are cluster-scoped object so namespace-scoped users can&amp;rsquo;t actually interact with them.
This was a business requirement so I had to setup a custom clusterrole that will let users setup their own persistentvolumes.</description>
